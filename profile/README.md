<h2 align="center"> 📜 About us </h2>

In today’s era of modernization, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives. Many eminent schools with computer clubs have come up with the idea of an IT fest.

As our motto says, we believe in doing the impossible. We believe that a piece of code is mightier than a pen as well as a sword. We are a team, excelling in various fields such as computer programming, web development, photo and video editing etc. We fascinate people by our creations, and draw people to the magnificent and unexplored world of computers.
